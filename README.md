# OpenAI Triton Tutorial

This repository contains my personal work on the OpenAI Triton tutorial exercises. Triton is a language and compiler designed to simplify GPU programming and automate optimizations, allowing developers to focus on the high-level logic of their parallel code. The original blog post can be found [here](https://openai.com/blog/triton/) and the tutorial [here](https://triton-lang.org/master/index.html).

## Getting Started

To get started with running the exercises, you can use [Lambda Labs](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/instances) to create an instance and take advantage of their GPUs. Once your instance is set up, you can run the Jupyter notebooks within the instance. Remember to turn off the Lambda Labs instance when you're done to avoid unnecessary charges!

Other resources like Google Colab and Kaggle might also work for running these exercises, but I haven't tried them extensively. Please note that I'm not affiliated with any of these platforms, and these suggestions aren't endorsements-- they're just what I've actually used before.
